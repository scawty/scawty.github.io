title: 'AI Products That Work'
---

I've used a lot of new AI products over the past few months and am starting to see a pattern in what is working and what isn't.

Building with LLMs is like hiring a smart graduate for every task. They have general intelligence and follow instructions well, but have little domain expertise. 

And it's actually worse than that: each time you ask them to perform some task, you're handing a brand new graduate the same set of instructions. By default, they have no memory, don't accumulate experience or learn from what they've done. 

**But**, they are orders of magnitude cheaper and faster than a real person, and you can build systems to work with them that:
- Bake in expertise and domain knowledge
- Allow them to improve over time
- Reduce and mitigate their mistakes

Take resume reviews, for example. A graduate gives generic advice you could Google. "Use action verbs," "quantify results." But if you're hiring a resume service, you've probably already tried the obvious stuff.

A veteran recruiter knows the details that get people interviews: that a certain ATS now filters by location first, or that AI startups respond better to "AI" than "ML" in resume bullet points, for example. This specific, current knowledge about what actually gets interviews is infinitely more valuable than generic resume advice.

Most LLM products fail to deliver value because they are like the resume review service using graduates. They're thin wrappers around general intelligence. If you're a founder building on top of LLMs or a PM working on AI features and you want to know if you are doing a good job bridging this gap, look at your metrics. Specifically retention. If you're not much more than a wrapper, what you'll likely see is users trying your product and abandoning it.

So what specifically can you do to bridge this gap?

You need to create a system to use human expertise to measure and improve your AI system. [Here](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/field-guide/) is by far the best guide I've seen on the subject.

The way that you build and execute on this system is your moat, and right now it's fairly obvious as a user who is doing this and who is not.
